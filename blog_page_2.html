							André Rieu has confirmed that he will be returning

							Australian tour will commence Tuesday 3 May in 
							Adelaide at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre.<br>
							<br>
							Recovering from his illness at his home in 
							Maastricht, André said &quot;I am so thrilled and excited 
							to be able to come back to Australia and New Zealand 
							in May. I look forward to the most amazing concerts! 
							Thank you all for your support and love, it has been 
							the best medicine for my recovery! See you in May!&quot;<br>
							<br>
							The Seekers will, of course, still be joining André 
							on stage for the full tour and will be performing 
							their biggest hits and most loved songs with the 
							backing of the Johann Strauss Orchestra.<br>
							<br>
							Fans of André Rieu, who have already purchased 
							tickets to the 2010 shows, will automatically be

									“he expects to make a full recovery and will

								<p align="left">A message on

								Thank your very much for your understanding and

							Below is the international press release...<br>
							---<i><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br>
							Classical superstar André Rieu, one of the world’s 
							most successful artists, is coming to cinemas all 
							over Europe for an exclusive broadcast of the July 
							2010 installment of his renowned Live In Maastricht 
							concert. Arts Alliance Media, Europe’s leading 
							alternative content provider, are bringing the event 
							via satellite to cinemas in 27 countries.</span></i></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
							<i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The concert is 
							being captured live, and will be delivered via 
							satellite to cinemas in countries including the UK, 
							Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, 
							Norway, Czech Republic, and Hungary for a special 
							one-night-only performance on July 20<sup>th</sup>.
							</span></i></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
							<i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A musical 
							phenomenon, André Rieu is unlike anything else in 
							the entertainment world. Music fans can expect the 
							experience of a lifetime when they witness the only 
							classical concerts where the audience jump to their 
							feet and dance in the aisles. The highest-charting 
							classical instrumentalist of all time, having topped 
							the Billboard Hot Tour rankings with his sold-out 
							World Stadium Tour last year, André Rieu will now be 
							bringing his spectacular production to cinemas 
							across Europe.</span></i></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
							<i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Performed in front 
							of thousands of fans in the open air in André Rieu’s 
							home town of Maastricht, the highly lavish concerts 
							feature Rieu’s famous 50-piece Johann Strauss 
							Orchestra performing crowd-pleasing music against 
							some of the most elaborate and expensive sets ever 
							seen.</span></i></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
							<i><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now fans in 27 
							countries can see for themselves just why André Rieu 
							is the biggest solo male touring artist in the 
							world. Conducting the Johann Strauss Orchestra with 
							his violin bow – just like the composer himself – 
							Rieu’s onstage charisma and rock-star demeanour make 
							this cinema event simply irresistible, and now fans 
							can experience the show themselves in pristine 
							digital cinema quality.</span></i></p>

									<font size="2">TORONTO (BNO NEWS) — G20 
									protests have forced Dutch violinist André 
									Rieu and his orchestra to cancel a planned 
									concert in Toronto on Saturday, police said.<br>
									<br>
									Rieu was scheduled to perform, along with 
									his 55 piece Johann Strauss Orchestra, at 
									the Air Canada Centre in Toronto on Saturday 
									night, at a time when world leaders are 
									meeting in the Canadian city.<br>
									<br>
									But peaceful protests turned violent in some 
									parts of downtown Toronto on Saturday, 
									forcing additional street closures and other 
									security measures. Some cars were set on 
									fire while protesters smashed windows and 
									turned against police officers.<br>
									<br>
									“What a sad moment! We all where sic ready 
									for a concert in Toronto,” Rieu wrote on his 
									Twitter account. “The police closed all 
									roads so nobody could come to the hall. We 
									had to leave.”<br>
									<br>
									Rieu said all tickets sold for Saturday’s 
									concert will be valid during a new concert 
									in December. “We come back in December. The 
									date we let you know as soon as possible. I 
									am very sad,” he added.<br>
									<br>
									Constable Wendy Drummond of Toronto Police 
									confirmed the concert had been cancelled 
									because of protests.<br>
									<br>
									Rieu is one of the best selling live acts in 
									the world, outselling artists such as 
									Britney Spears and Beyonce. He sold more 
									than 800,000 tickets last year and has sold 
									more than 30 million albums worldwide.<br>
