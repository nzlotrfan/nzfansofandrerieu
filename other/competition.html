<p><font face="Arial">Hey there folks!<br>
<br>
The <b><font size="4">Good Morning TV show</font></b> that airs weekdays at 
9:00am - 12:00pm on TV1, have recently held a talent competition. The deal was 
that the entrant had to create a short 90 second DVD extract showcasing their 
talent. If the entrant is selected, the entrant goes into the <b><font size="4">
final 15</font></b>, then New Zealand audience must <b><font size="4">TXT vote</font></b> 
to put through their favourite performer into the<font size="4"> <b>final 5</b></font>, 
then the winner is selected by a panel of judges. <br>
<br>
The winner receives a pretty alright package!!! - A trip to Australia!!!!, &quot;<i>...Not 
only that but you'll also recieve a career design package from agent and country 
singer Gray Bartlett, who has launched the careers of stars like Hayley Westenra 
and Yulia. And, if you are a singer or instrumentalist, a recording of a song.</i>&quot; 
and a few more awesome things!<br>
<br>
SOOOOoooo!!<br>
Last weekend (30th &amp; 31st May), we (Mum, Dad &amp; my sister Anneliese) recorded a 
video of me singing 'Call Me Irresponsible', and on Tuesday <font size="4">sent 
it down</font> to Good Morning HQ at Avalon Studios, in Wellington. What an 
exciting weekend it was! <br>
<br>
Anyway! Today (Friday 5th June) the competition closed at 11:00am. I got a phone 
call on my cellphone at school during my last class, (luckily I was outside when 
the phone rang!) to be told I made the <b><font size="4">final 15</font></b>!!! 
WOW!! <br>
<font size="4"><br>
<b>So now I need your help!!!</b></font><b><br>
</b>My video will be aired on Good Morning <span style="font-size: 14pt"><b>this 
Monday </b></span>at 10:30AM exactly (show starts at 
9:00AM though), so what <b><font size="4">I need you to do</font></b>.... I am 
contestant 'E'. After my video has played, you can vote for me by txting &quot;E&quot; 
(without quotations) to 8687. <b><font size="4">But</font></b>.... I know lots 
of you work or won't be available to watch it, so therefore, the voting lines 
will be open from 10:35am Monday and will close when the show finishes, so you 
would need to vote before 11:45am to be safe.<br>
<br>
Special credit while I'm at it goes to Dad, who operated the sound, Mum who 
operated zoom in and zoom out functions, and my sister Anneliese who operated 
the camera in general. <br>
<br>
Thanks so much for your support, and I'll really appreciate your vote!! :-)<br>
<br clear="all">
Cheers,<br>
Reuben<br>
