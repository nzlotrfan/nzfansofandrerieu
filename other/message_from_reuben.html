<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hey folks!!<br>
<br>
Wow! What an exciting Monday it was today!! Thanks soooo much for all your txt 
votes today! It was totally worth it, because,,, </font>
<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>I GOT IN</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">! 
Yay!!!! – To the grand finale! And it wouldn’t have happened without you all! I 
just want to say a </font><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>BIG 
THANK YOU</b> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">for all the people who voted 
for me today, and for all the people who have always supported me. It’s been an 
entertaining, stressing, but worth it past couple of days. All of my 
grandparents learnt how to txt in the weekend, preparing for today, and my Mum, 
Dad, Sister, my neighbours from across the road, and the rest of my family and 
friends all put in such an awesome effort to encourage people to watch and vote 
for me. So thanks to everyone once again.<br>
<br>
Now my thank yous are over, </font><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 14pt">
<b>what happened</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">?? I was in Hamilton for 
the regional barbershop competition, I was a part of our schools barber quartet. 
The day had come to an end, and we had stopped at the local McDonalds in 
Hamilton. I was starting to think that maybe I didn’t make it through as it was 
just about 4pm. Anyway, at 3:44pm, I </font>
<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>got the call</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial"> 
from a TVNZ Good Morning person congratulating me and saying I made it to the 
grand finale!! It was very exciting, I spent a long time on the phone with her 
discussing things about me, and technical things for getting down to Wellington. 
What a crazy afternoon?!?<br>
<br>
So </font><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>what happens now</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">?? 
I will be traveling to Wellington this Thursday afternoon and staying the night 
down there, ready to appear on the Good Morning show the following morning in
</font><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>Avalon Studios</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">. 
I’ll be performing ‘Call Me Irresponsible’ in front of a live studio audience 
plus three judges and you guys at home </font>
<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>battling it out</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial"> 
against four other contestants. The judges are Robert Rakete, Jackie Clarke and 
Stacey Morrison.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>Yes, I still need your help</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">!! 
There will be another voting system on the day, but because of the judges, it 
will be similar to Dancing With The Stars. The three judges will give a number 
score on each performance, holding up a sign saying ‘9’, ‘6’, ‘7’ for example. 
And then the TV audience will once again </font>
<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>txt vote</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial"> 
for their favourite performer. The txt votes will be added together along with 
the judges’ scores to determine the overall winner which is announced live on 
the show. <br>
