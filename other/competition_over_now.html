<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">Hey folks!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">What a week 
huh? Just in case you didn’t hear, I didn’t win. I (think) I came 4<sup>th</sup> 
out of the 5 contestants. But it’s not disappointing as it may sound! I had such 
a fabulous and amazing time down there! It truly was an experience I’ll never in 
a life time forget. When I landed in Wellington, I was picked up by a Good 
Morning driver and was driven to Avalon Studios. In the back seat of the car was 
Stacy Morrison, we had a great chat together, she was really lovely. When we 
arrived at Avalon after dropping Stacy off to the Bolton hotel, I met up with 
the other contestants (except for Anthony as he had an exam), Astar, and some 
Good Morning organisers. We had a tour of the studio (which was still under 
construction at the time!) we were to be performing in, and then we just chilled 
out, eating pizza for dinner together. After a great meet and greet session, we 
then headed for the fancy 5 star Bolton Hotel, and relaxed (I even had a bath 
!!) before heading off for an early night sleep. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">Anyway, 
after a sleepless night, I awoke to my wake-up call at 5:30am, (yes 5:30AM!!) 
got myself packed, and then headed down to the restaurant for a buffet 
breakfast. We all met Anthony for the first time then too, as he arrived at the 
hotel late the night before. So after a lovely breakfast, we headed out to 
Avalon. Avalon was busy busy! In the mad rush of everything, we met the 
presenters, judges, crew,… just everyone really! It was really exciting! We all 
went and put our costumes on, ready to have our make-up done. I then went and 
had my sound check; it was great to get a feel for what my performance would 
feel like. We then sat and waited nervously in the green room (the main place to 
be if you weren’t on stage). Then 8:50am came around, we were all sitting on the 
interview couches ready to go on air. There was a TV in the green room which was 
a direct link from the video mixing room, so we could see what was airing on the 
TV right then. The studio audience had a quick rehearsal of clapping, laughing 
and smiling and all, as we had our quick rehearsal saying our names and all on 
the interview couch. Then the stage runner lady said “quiet in the green room! 
30 seconds!” Then she pointed at Steve who was introducing us all at the 
beginning of the show, and away it went! </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">After 
contestant ‘A’, Renee had performed, my interview time came up. - I sat on the 
interview couch and had my drink bottle right next to me. After the interview 
was over, the stage runner lady took me down to the stage. I stood ready on the 
little blue marking tape on the stage in front of the studio audience. And then 
the director yelled out “quiet studio audience! 30 seconds …. 5, 4, 3” Then she 
pointed at Steve who was doing my quick little introduction, and then it was all 
me! Wow! The music went straight on, then all the cameras were following me. I 
can’t remember what exactly was going through my head. The initial nervousness 
disappeared after I had sung the first two words, as the whole studio audience 
went ‘oooh!’ and ‘whooooooa’ type thing, it was really awesome, that’s what 
really gave me that buzz to just enjoy it. It was good to hear what the judges 
had to say and all. Then when my time had finished, the judges had finished and 
we were off air, the judges all came up and shook my hand and said well done to 
me really personally. It was really great to have them come up to me during the 
ad break. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">The whole 
entire time I was there for was just amazing. After the show had finished, 
contestants and friends and family all went and joined the presenters, judges, 
organisers and crew for a lovely shared lunch. We heard some great comments from 
everyone afterwards, this was the best part about the whole experience, once 
Anthony had won, everyone was treated still like stars and equal. It was so 
great to be apart of it all, it was the most well organised event I’ve ever been 
involved in. - The cast, crew, presenters and especially the other contestants 
were such lovely and friendly people, there was nothing more I could have asked 
for. So not winning was not a disappointment, the whole trip was just an amazing 
and thrilling experience I will never forget! </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">So bringing 
the email to a close, how I could I finish without writing a BIG thank you to 
all the 100s and 100s and 100s of people who voted for me?! From my first 
audition video to the grand finals, I received (and still am receiving) many, 
many emails from heaps of people congratulating for me for getting this far. I 
know there were lots of people voting for me, people from school, friends &amp; 
family and people I don’t even know, from all around the country. And there were 
even friends &amp; family watching live over the internet from overseas! If it 
wasn’t for all your support, I wouldn’t have made it this far I’m sure. I 
honestly can’t thank everyone enough for all their help and support over the 
past week, if I could thank you all individually, I would be here forever! But 
for what it’s worth, thanks everyone! – Even if you couldn’t vote for me, I’ve 
heard about your support through the family. </span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">It’s been 
such an exciting week, and I know I’ve made my family &amp; friends proud. I was 
told that over one thousand videos were entered. So though I didn’t win, to make 
it this far is so thrilling and such an achievement. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">Thanks a 
million to everyone again!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-NZ">You’ve made 
my year!</span></font></p>
