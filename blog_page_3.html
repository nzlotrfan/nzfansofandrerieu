									Reserve concert ticket, two nights 
									accommodation at a four star city hotel, 
									continental breakfasts and pre-show bubbly.

							<i>The following article found on the

							California Chronicle</a> may be of interest to some. 
							:-)</i><br>
							---<br>
							The first quarter of 2010 saw a 43% year-on-year 
							rise in sales of classical music, demonstrating the 
							public's appetite is stronger than ever. Classical's 
							challenge now is to harness that enthusiasm and push 
							sales harder, whether by focusing on downloads, TV 
							reality shows or specialist awards ceremonies<br>
							<br>
							By Andrew Stewart<br>
							<br>
							THE STATE OF THE NATION'S PUBLIC FINANCES and future 
							spending cuts could yet stifle the diversity of an 
							arts sector that has punched far above its weight in 
							recent years.<br>
							<br>
							For now, the classical music industry is looking to 
							protect its interests by boosting income from sales 
							of tickets and recorded product. Healthy box-office 
							receipts and advance bookings for live performances 
							suggest that the UK's classical music organisations, 
							in company with theatres, galleries and museums, 
							have been able to buck the recession by programming 
							bold events.<br>
							<br>
							Classical recording companies face the challenge of 
							attracting new consumers and encouraging existing 
							ones to explore key releases and catalogue titles. 
							Their cause should be helped by media and consumer 
							interest in two Q2 awards shows; one devoted to core 
							classical titles, the other addressed to the 
							interests of the mass market.<br>
							<br>
							The fifth BBC Music Magazine Awards, presented at 
							Kings Place in central London on April 13, offered a 
							celebration of excellence in new classical 
							recordings and highlighted the quality of repertoire 
							at both major and independent labels. Meanwhile, 
							classical music's evolving mass-market reach stands 
							proud in the list of nominations and performers 
							announced for this year's Classical Brit Awards.<br>
							<br>
							The Classical Brits nominees include a substantial 
							offering of core artists such as Thomas Ades, Marin 
							Alsop, Angela Gheorghiu, Jack Liebeck, Anna Netrebko, 
							Antonio Pappano, Vasily Petrenko and Bryn Terfel. 
							The 10 titles shortlisted for album of the year 
							represent a solid line-up of classical crossover 
							artists, including the Band of the Coldstream 
							Guards, Blake, The Priests, Rhydian Roberts, Faryl 
							Smith and Gary Barlow protege Camilla Kerslake. 
							Although Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Andre Rieu, Terfel and 
							Rolando Villazon are all set to appear at the Royal 
							Albert Hall on May 13, Rhydian, Camilla Kerslake, 
							Blake and Hayley Westenra will guarantee that the 
							show projects a strong crossover flavour.<br>
							<br>
							Classical Brit Awards committee co-chairman and 
							Decca Records general manager Mark Wilkinson 
							stresses the need for record companies and retailers 
							to maximise marketing opportunities arising from 
							award-show success. 'I think there's a lot for the 
							classical industry to shout about at the moment,' he 
							says. Wilkinson points to a 43% year-on-year rise in 
							Q1 classical sales, adding that more than 2,500 
							classical albums were released by around 90 record 
							labels in the UK last year, reflecting a diverse and 
							competitive market space.<br>
							<br>
							This year's BBC Music Magazine Awards and the 
							Classical Brits bear witness to the breadth of 
							classical repertoire offered by seasoned performers 
							and young artists alike. The former awards honoured 
							veteran pianist Murray Perahia in company with 
							established conductors Antonio Pappano and Semyon 
							Bychkov, whose account of Wagner's Lohengrin was 
							named as record of the year. A crop of young artists 
							to win at the event included Moldovan violinist 
							Patricia Kopatchinskaja, Dutch mezzo-soprano 
							Christianne Stotijn and the UK- based Elias String 
							Quartet.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;Artists and record companies will only see 
							immediate benefits from an industry award if all 
							parties involved in selling and marketing work 
							together,&quot; notes Wilkinson. &quot;You cannot expect the 
							announcement of an award on television or in a 
							magazine to set the tills ringing.&quot; He cites the 
							presence of Andre Rieu among the artists to perform 
							at this year's Classical Brits.<br>
							<br>
							At the time of their last show in May 2009, the 
							60-year-old Dutch violinist and his Johann Strauss 
							Orchestra were a minor concern in the UK when 
							compared to the mass audiences they command in 
							central Europe and Australia. But his UK status 
							changed last December when Rieu's appearance the 
							Royal Variety Show kick-started sales of his Forever 
							Vienna album.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;He has been the definition of the word phenomenon 
							in the classical business this year, coming from 
							nowhere to dominate the pop chart, the classical 
							chart and the specialist classical chart,&quot; says 
							Wilkinson. &quot;The Royal Variety Show set the agenda 
							when he reached its peak viewership - that awoke 
							media and consumer interest. We've been pushing the 
							boundaries with him ever since and will carry that 
							momentum forward with his appearance at the 
							Classical Brits.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							At EMI Classics, company president Eric Dingman is 
							looking to add a long tail to award-winning albums. 
							The Classical Brits, he says, offers strong 
							foundations on which to build interest in core EMI 
							classical artists. His label hosts Dame Kiri Te 
							Kanawa's appearance at the show as performer and 
							recipient of the 2010 Classical Brit lifetime 
							achievement in music award. &quot;It's a very special 
							opportunity for us to be part of a grand recognition 
							of her accomplishments, which is why our chairman 
							and just about every senior executive are showing up 
							for this great occasion,&quot; he says.<br>
							<br>
							Dingman says EMI Classics is targeting retail and 
							media campaigns aimed at boosting sales of composer 
							of the year nominee Thomas Ades, female artist of 
							the year shortlister Angela Gheorghiu and Antonio 
							Pappano, nominated for Classical Brits in the male 
							artist and the critic's award categories. Pappano 
							could scoop a rare double if his recording of 
							Verdi's Requiem bags the critics' prize, 
							complementing the acclaimed album's BBC Music 
							Magazine Award for best choral album.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;Clearly the Classical Brits reaches a broad 
							audience,' says Dingman. &quot;It's pleasing to see some 
							recognition here for the work we've done to support 
							Tom Ades. Tony Pappano's nominations for Madame 
							Butterfly and the Verdi Requiem, following his BBC 
							Music Magazine success and forthcoming BBC Four 
							Opera Italia series, underline the fact that this is 
							a big year for him. Angela is also excited to be 
							nominated for Butterfly. What we're aiming to do is 
							create broader exposure for these artists beyond the 
							core classical audience. We want to create momentum 
							and grow the audience for their recordings.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							Growing the classical market is clearly on the mind 
							of Decca managing director Dickon Stainer. 'We've 
							had our strongest three months in the classical 
							market ever in Q1 this year. It is the first time 
							our market share has reached 70% and the market is 
							up across the board.&quot; The pop chart success of Andre 
							Rieu's Forever Vienna album, he admits, has clearly 
							driven classical sales in the quarter, adding the 
							violinist's meteoric rise in the UK underlines the 
							potential of core classical repertoire with the mass 
							market.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;If you had said six months ago that a Dutchman in a 
							waistcoat playing the Blue Danube Waltz was going to 
							be the biggest breaking act of 2010, people would 
							have thought you were crazy,&quot; he says. &quot;But that's 
							exactly what happened. It shows you can't 
							underestimate the appetite for the new and 
							different. Yes, Andre Rieu polarises tastes - but he 
							does play core classical music. He's the fastest- 
							breaking act in the UK this year in any genre, the 
							first breaking act to go platinum in 2010.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							Stainer argues that ITV1's Popstar to Operastar and 
							BBC Four's Sacred Music series, presented by Simon 
							Russell Beale and featuring The Sixteen, have opened 
							doors to new classical consumers. BBC Four's 
							forthcoming Opera Italia series, presented by 
							Antonio Pappano, belongs to the Decca head's list of 
							classical music entry points. &quot;These programmes can 
							open up conduits for people to discover interesting 
							and diverse streams of repertoire,&quot; he says. 
							&quot;'That's what we all need to do as record companies 
							and promoters of classical music.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							Awards shows and high-profile television programmes, 
							notes Stainer, are essential components in the 
							present marketing mix for classical music. But he 
							adds that it is now imperative for labels to 
							capitalise on media interest in the genre by growing 
							the online market for classical product. Although he 
							welcomes the near-50% rise in classical downloads 
							over the past year, Stainer is adamant that there is 
							much more to be done to extend the genre's online 
							reach.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;We need to promote digital more actively. The rate 
							of growth in digital consumption in the mainstream 
							pop and rock music business is way outstripping that 
							in classical. Some of that has to do with 
							demographics, but I believe the classical industry 
							has the responsibility to communicate and educate 
							about digital consumption. We're falling way short 
							of the model of the mainstream music business at a 
							time when retail space is shrinking. You would 
							expect digital consumption of niche classical genres 
							to be growing at a greater rate than for mainstream 
							chart titles available in supermarkets. The question 
							of how to grow that market has to top the classical 
							music industry's agenda.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							Stainer suggests that leading digital suppliers 
							should be encouraged to expand the supply of 
							classical single-track downloads. &quot;It puzzles me why 
							the classical page is the only page on iTunes not to 
							offer single tracks as well as albums,&quot; he comments. 
							&quot;It's an anomaly. We know from our own evidence that 
							people like to download single classical tracks, so 
							we have to make that as easy for them as possible.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							The rise of core artists with the ability to engage 
							young audiences and cross demographic divides offers 
							the most likely stimulus to classical download 
							sales. The recent signing of classical pianist James 
							Rhodes to Warner Brothers represents both a bold A&amp;R 
							move and an important stage in the development of 
							mainstream classics for the mass market. Although 
							Rhodes says it is too early to announce his Warner 
							Bros debut repertoire in full, works by Alkan and 
							Balakirev could well occupy a share of session time 
							when he comes to record later this summer.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;I'm so pleased that the Warners deal is with the 
							Madonna, Metallica, Led Zeppelin, big motherfucking 
							rock label, not on Warner Classics,&quot; he comments. &quot;I 
							made damn sure in the contract that they didn't have 
							control of repertoire. Down the line they can't say, 
							'Now we've got you, we want the first movement of 
							Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, Debussy's Claire de 
							lune...' I'd love to do the first movement of the 
							Moonlight Sonata, but only together with the other 
							two movements, because they're amazing.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							Rhodes' summer concert schedule includes dates at E4 
							Udderbelly and the Cheltenham Festival, as well as 
							becoming the first classical pianist to perform at 
							the Latitude Festival this July.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;What other option is there but to reach out to that 
							audience?&quot; he asks. It's more than a rhetorical 
							question for the whole classical record business.<br>

							If you've been looking for just the right gift to 
							say &quot;thanks Mum, I love you&quot;, then look no further 
							because You Raise Me Up offers a Mother's Day 
							solution that you know she'll love. Plus, if you're 
							feeling extra generous, you could also shout Mum 
							tickets to one of his New Zealand concerts in 
							October!<br>
							<br>
							Imagine this: Out of complete silence emerges the 
							sound of a solo violin and the album opens with the 
							true No.1 song of this century - the most covered 
							song in the last ten years - 'You Raise Me Up'.<br>
							<br>
							We then accompany Andre on a journey to the world of 
							flowers with the title track from the 1979 film 'The 
							Rose', starring Bette Middler, followed by a tribute 
							to nature in the form of a waltz (Johann Strauss's 
							'Roses from the South') from the undisputed King of 
							the Waltz, Andre Rieu, a timeless chanson ('Autumn 
							Leaves'), and a tribute to the night sky ('There is 
							a song in me') via Chopin.<br>
							<br>
							It's but a short journey from the world of waltzes 
							to the world of operetta and Andre's new CD brings 
							us those timeless melodies from Kalman's 'The Gypsy 
							Princess' (a great Mantovani hit) and the gorgeous 
							song 'Love Live Forever'. From there we take another 
							short ride to the world of musicals, for two numbers 
							from the Disney musical of the moment - 'Mary 
							Poppins', and the incredibly moving 'Send in the 
							Clowns' from Sondheim's A Little Night Music. Not 
							forgetting the song of songs that climbed to the top

							<p>'Forever Vienna' (+ Bonus Live in Royal Albert

							<a href="#violinist-andre-rieu-makes-pop-chart-history-with-album">
							back in early February this year</a>, Andr� was all 
							over the news because he made it to Number two in 
							the UK Pop charts. This was very exciting for all 
							Andr� fans everywhere, as it is a huge achievement 
							for a classical album to get into the pop charts. 
							However, even with all this going on, New Zealand 
							was (as usual) left out of the loop, until now. </p>

							<p>Andre Rieu doesn't have the air of a man on a 
							mission. Relaxing over lunch in his Zurich hotel, 
							the violinist and conductor is engaging company. </p>
							<p>And, while his wavy, shoulder-length hair would 
							suggest the talented Dutchman might be a bit of a 
							showman on the sly, he blends in unobtrusively with 
							his surroundings. </p>
							<p>It is only later, when he plays a Swiss 
							ice-hockey arena with his Johann Strauss Orchestra, 
							laughing and joking through a two-hour show, that it 
							becomes apparent that Rieu, 60, is a classical 
							musician with a difference. </p>

								<p style="text-align: left;" class="imageCaption">
								Pulling strings: Violinist Andre Rieu brings a 
								spectacle - he has sold 30million albums 
								worldwide </div>
							<p>In injecting wit, irreverence and spontaneity 
							into a genre often associated with stuffiness, he 
							has become an international phenomenon, 
							single-handedly spearheading a revival of 
							19th-century waltz music. </p>
							<p>'The waltz encapsulates all emotions in life, and 
							that's why people love it,' he tells me. 'I was 
							attracted by the sheer joy in the music of Johann 
							Strauss. It is very uplifting, and that's what I try 
							to capture onstage. </p>
							<p>'I don't think you can conduct a Strauss waltz 
							with a baton. You should just play it and try to get 
							people on their feet. It's so dull when you go to a 
							classical concert and everyone just sits there. That 
							wasn't how Strauss wanted his music to be heard.' </p>
							<p>Rieu is doing something right. He has sold 30 
							million albums and is one of the world's most 
							successful touring acts, playing to packed houses. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
							<p>In the past six weeks, he has also secured the 
							British breakthrough that had previously eluded him: 
							his current release, Forever Vienna, last month 
							leapt to No 2 in the charts and is still selling 
							strongly. </p>
							<p>It became the UK's highest-charting orchestral 
							album ever, its impact likened to that made two 
							decades ago by Nigel Kennedy with Vivaldi's The Four 
							Seasons. </p>
							<div class="thinCenter">

								<img src="Blog_Pics/article-0-0889C2B7000005DC-238_468x565.jpg" alt="Chart topper: Rieu's Forever Vienna, last month leapt to No 2 in " class="blkBorder" height="501" width="416" style="border: 2px solid #FFFFFF">

								<p style="text-align: left;" class="imageCaption">
								Chart topper: Rieu's Forever Vienna, last month 
								leapt to No 2 in the charts and became the UK's 
								highest-charting orchestral album ever</div>
							<p>Rieu believes there are a number of reasons for 
							his success: the popularity of shows such as 
							Strictly Come Dancing has helped, while his rousing 
							tunes are seen as an antidote to the worst recession 
							since the Thirties and the bleakest winter in 30 
							years. </p>
							<p>'My record label, Decca, didn't think I'd ever be 
							a hit in the UK,' he says. 'They thought I'd only 
							make it in Europe. But then Forever Vienna became a 
							hit in Australia, and that made them reconsider.' </p>
							<p>In December, Rieu also attracted the admiration 
							of the Queen, who complimented him on his 'beautiful 
							melodies' when he stole the show from Lady Gaga and 
							Mika at the Royal Variety Performance. </p>
							<p>In front of an audience, Andre and his 50-piece 
							orchestra truly bring the music to life. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
							<p>The live shows are not only witty - he puts his 
							musicians through their paces with demonic grins and 
							archly-raised eyebrows - they are also audiovisual 
							extravaganzas, with a brilliant light show, floral 
							displays, lavishly decorated stage sets and 
							slapstick comedy routines. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
							<p>His openair events take things even further, and 
							have featured horses, ice rinks and a fairytale 
							castle. It is an approach to classical music that 
							makes even The Last Night Of The Proms seem staid. </p>
							<p>Rieu explains: 'In classical music, humour is 
							usually frowned upon. I don't know why. I couldn't 
							live without humour. I'm the leader of 50 idiots who 
							travel around the world playing waltzes, and we 
							solve all our problems with humour.' </p>
							<p>'If somebody drives 100 miles to see a concert, 
							you can at least dress up and decorate the stage 
							with a few flowers.' </p>
							<p>He denies charges that he is dumbing down 
							classical music or trivialising the work of greats. 
							'I take the music very seriously - but I add a touch 
							of lightness,' he says. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
							<p>'The critics and purists kill me, but I play 
							music that touches my heart. Some people use 
							classical music to appear superior; I don't have 
							time for snobbery.' </p>
							<p>Rieu began playing the violin at five in his 
							hometown of Maastricht, where his father led the 
							local symphony orchestra. </p>
							<p>After studying at an academy in Brussels, he 
							formed the Maastricht Salon Orchestra, which became 
							the Johann Strauss Orchestra in the Eighties.</p>
							<p>'My father used to play waltzes as an encore,' he 
							says. 'I noticed that people suddenly got up and 
							started moving and humming along. That taught me you 
							could make music a different way.' </p>
							<p>With the help of his wife Marjorie (they have 
							been married for 35 years and have two grown-up 
							sons, plus three grandchildren), Rieu turned his 
							live show into a spectacular. </p>
							<p>He is now looking to consolidate his success in 
							the UK. A major arena tour is being put together. He 
							is also playing the Classical Brit Awards at the 
							Royal Albert Hall on May 13. More audacious plans 
							are in the pipeline. 'I'd love to do something with 
							Bruce Springsteen,' he says. 'We could create 
							something that nobody would expect. </p>
							<p>'And, one day, I'd like to play on the moon.' 
							When I laugh, he says: 'I mean it! I've never met 
							Richard Branson, but if he could build a hall up 
							there, I'd get people waltzing on the moon.' </p>

							be given the award.<br>
							<br>
							The 11th annual Classical Brits will take place at 
							the Royal Albert Hall on 13 May.<br>
							<br>
							Mark Wilkinson from the Classical Brit Awards

							befriended British audiences and helped to nurture 
							new singing talent for so many years&quot;.<br>

							<br>
							<b>Global audience</b><br>
							<br>
							The singer was born into a Maori background in 1944 
							and adopted by a couple in the Gisborne region of 
							New Zealand, who called her Kiri, the Maori word for 
							Bell.<br>
							<br>
							In 1966, she was given a government grant to enable 
							her to train at the London Opera Centre, and five 
							years later she landed her first major role as the 
							Countess in a production of Mozart's The Marriage Of 
							Figaro at Covent Garden.<br>
							<br>
							She is probably best-known for singing Handel's Let 
							The Bright Seraphim at the wedding of Prince Charles 
							and Lady Diana in 1981 - a performance watched by an 
							estimated worldwide audience of 600 million.<br>
							<br>
							She was made a dame in 1982, and reached a global 
							audience again in the 1990s at the debut of Sir Paul 
							McCartney's Liverpool Oratorio.<br>
							<br>
							Earlier this year, Dame Kiri launched a nationwide 
							search for an opera star of the future.<br>
							<br>
							The winner of the BBC Radio 2 Kiri Prize will get 
							the chance to perform with her at Radio 2's Proms In 
							The Park in September.<br>

							The awards, which will be broadcast on ITV1, are to

							<br>
							<i>Dutch violinist Andr� Rieu will also perform at 
							the live show.</i><br>

							<p>Strange things have been happening in the British 
							pop charts of late (and no, we�re not talking about 
							Jedward�s failure to clinch number one). Wade 
							through the usual Lady Gaga, Florence and the 
							Machine and Paolo Nutini albums, and there in the 
							No2 spot is Andre Rieu and his album Forever Vienna.<br>
							<br>
							The cover alone stands out: a couple dance dreamily 
							around a ballroom. The man, dressed in a traditional 
							tailcoat, holds his partner in an elaborate swoon. 
							She, wearing a swishy ball gown, has her neck bent 
							in the direction of the window. They are waltzing � 
							to the tune of the Dutch violinist Andre Rieu and 
							his Johann Strauss Orchestra.<br>
							<br>
							Forever Vienna, a compilation of traditional 
							waltzes, has beaten Hot Chip, Corinne Bailey Rae, 
							Journey and Peter Andre, all of whom have had new 
							albums out this week. Not only is it the 
							highest-charting orchestral album in history, but it 
							is also the first time a CD of 19th-century music 
							has appeared in the charts. So what on earth is 
							going on?<br>
							<br>
							The waltz revival has been gathering pace ever since 
							Rieu, a conductor�s son from Maastricht, started 
							blowing the cobwebs off the form with his elaborate 
							50-piece orchestra. Formed in 1987 with only 12 
							members, the Johann Strauss Orchestra soon earned a 
							reputation for its lively, emotive performances, 
							with Rieu being named �the king of the waltz�.<br>
							<br>
							Not for him drab musicians all in black. Instead his 
							dapper players perform in full tailcoats and bright, 
							slightly daring ball gowns. As their popularity 
							grew, so did their stage sets. During their recent 
							world tour, a life-size reproduction of the Viennese 
							Imperial Sch�nbrunn Palace dominated the stage, 
							complete with two ice rinks, two fountains and a 
							huge ballroom dance floor. But the pi�ce de 
							r�sistance is Rieu himself, who leads the dances 
							from the front using his 1667 Stradivarius violin, 
							reportedly worth �2.3m (Dh11.6m).<br>
							<br>
							�Waltzes were not meant to be conducted,� he said 
							recently in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. 
							�I lead with my bow, my head, my whole body, just as 
							Johann Strauss did.� The UK is, it seems, not the 
							only country to have fallen under his spell. In 
							Billboard magazine�s list of the top 25 tours last 
							summer, Rieu was in fourth place, ahead of Coldplay, 
							Bruce Springsteen and Celine Dion. Only Madonna, 
							Britney Spears and Tina Turner lay ahead of him.<br>
							<br>
							Having originated in Vienna in the mid-18th century, 
							the waltz, which is traditionally performed in 3/4 
							time, quickly spread across Europe. It was, though, 
							not without its detractors, many of whom saw the 
							dancers� proximity as �indecent�. The death knell 
							sounded when the style began to shift from the 
							ballroom to the music hall. And it was not until 
							Rieu started bringing it to the masses once more, 
							that the waltz experienced renewed popularity.<br>
							<br>
							�My father was a conductor, and I grew up listening 
							to his concerts,� Rieu told The Daily Telegraph, 
							�and I noticed that, when he played waltzes as 
							encores, the audience seemed different. They smiled, 
							they started to move in their seats. This music 
							still had a magic power to move people. That made a 
							big impression on me.�<br>
							<br>
							The recent album sales have, said Rieu�s spokesman, 
							partly been due to the proliferation of dance shows 
							like Strictly Come Dancing and So You Think You Can 
							Dance? �The waltz has been an important part of many 
							of these shows and it really seems to have captured 
							the public�s imagination,� he said. One suspects 
							that Rieu�s silver-fox appeal also has something to 
							do with it.<br>
							<br>
							And so what of the album? It has most of the greats, 
							from The Blue Danube and the Bol�ro to the Radeztky 
							March. They are exuberant and full of colour and it 
							is easy to see why the waltz is going strong 250 
							years on. Rieu is obviously there, but not to the 
							extent that you would suspect from classical music�s 
							poster boy.<br>
							<br>
							Having trained at the Conservatoire Royal in Li�ge 
							and in the Conservatorium Maastricht, he is a gifted 
							player. And he has a few words for those who dismiss 
							his style as populist. �I give myself what I want,� 
							he said recently to The Times, �not what people 
							want. I play that music in a way I want to play. I 
							don�t change the music: I play it as it should be 
							played. And I take my job seriously.�</p>

							<p>Andr� Rieu beat pop stars 
							including Paolo Nutini, Florence and the Machine and 
							Lady Gaga with his album Forever Vienna.</p>
							<p>The Dutchman put his surprising 
							surge in popularity down to the success of 
							prime-time TV dance shows such as Strictly Come 
							Dancing and Dancing On Ice.</p>
							<p>The record is not only the 
							highest-charting orchestral album ever, but also the 
							first time a CD of 19th century music has appeared 
							in the pop charts.</p>
							<p>Forever Vienna has steadily beaten 
							off competition from Susan Boyle, Cheryl Cole and 
							Michael Buble in the six weeks since it was 
							released.</p>
							<p>The album completely sold out in 
							its first week of release and sales have since 
							snowballed, with the album going gold - reaching 
							400,000 sales - in just three weeks and taking the 
							No.1 spot in all of the major supermarket sales 
							charts.</p>
							<p>Since the UK Album Charts began in 
							1958, only once � when violinist Nigel Kennedy 
							reached No.3 over 20 years ago � has classical 
							instrumental music made such an impact. </p>
							<p>Kennedy brought Vivaldi into 
							thousands homes with his landmark Four Seasons 
							recording, which peaked at No.3. </p>
							<p>The UK is the latest in a string 
							of countries to be swept off their feet by the 
							violinist and his Johann Strauss Orchestra. He is 
							already a huge international star with his tours, 
							outselling music heavyweights Bruce Springsteen, 
							Coldplay and AC/DC.</p>

							<p>'At his live concert, people 
							actually get up and dance like they did when Strauss 
							used to be performed the first time around in 
							Vienna.'</p>
							<p>Rieu said: �The waltz encapsulates

							<p>Gennaro Castaldo, of HMV, said:

							this album he has shown music fans in the UK why.
							<br>
&nbsp;</p>
							<p>'He certainly has a talent for 
							bringing traditional waltz music to life, to be 
							enjoyed in the way it was in its heyday.</p>
							<p>'The success of classical music 
							crossing over into the pop mainstream has been

							relatively unknown in the UK until recently, to be 
							in the top 2 and outselling the likes of Lady Gaga 
							and Florence and the Machine suggests that something 
							a little deeper is happening.</p>
							<p>'Clearly, many fans have taken to 
							Rieu's engaging personality and infectious brand of 
							music, but it also seems likely the public's 
							fascination with all things dance right now, and 
							with the likes of Strictly and Dancing on Ice in 
							particular, is also helping to boost sales.'</p>

							<p>The 60-year-old is a massive star 
							elsewhere in the world, selling out stadiums to 
							become the sixth highest grossing live act of 2009 - 
							beating Britney, Chris Martin and co, Elton John and 
							Tina Turner - but in the UK he's a virtual unknown.<br>
							<br>
							Now, thoug, Rieu is sitting in the top 10 of the UK 
							album chart with Forever Vienna, an impressive feat 
							for a recording of traditional waltzes.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;<i>There's a big audience out there who loves our 
							music</i>,&quot; Rieu told Sky News as he toasted his new 
							success.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;<i>I think they were a little bit forgotten by the 
							record companies. I think classical music has so 
							many beautiful things to show the people, and that's 
							what I do.</i>&quot;<br>
							<br>
							Rieu's attempts to put the showbiz back into 
							classical may annoy some purists, but you can't deny 
							the size of his ambitions.<br>
							<br>
							Last year his huge stadium tour included two 
							ice-skating rinks, a ballroom, flying angels, 
							bagpipes and a horse-drawn carriage. The stage was 
							even larger than U2's.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;<i>It was the biggest touring set in the world</i>&quot; 
							smiles Rieu proudly.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;<i>We travelled with 500 people. That's madness, 
							but it was fun to do, and it worked. Usually fun and 
							classical music doesn't go together, I don't know 
							why.</i>&quot;</p>
							<p>Rieu's a wonderfully quirky man 
							who rides a bike around sound check and insists he 
							wants to be the first performer to play waltz music 
							on the moon.<br>
							<br>
							Thanks to his popularity in Australia, he even 
							played his violin down Ramsay Street, during a cameo 
							turn in Neighbours.<br>
							<br>
							But it's his instinct for crowd-pleasing that has 
							helped him sell more than 30 million albums, and 
							earnt him the unlikely status as a classical sex 
							symbol.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;<i>Am I?</i>&quot; he laughs. &quot;<i>It's the way we play 
							music, the way I make contact with the audience.</i>&quot;<br>
							<br>
							&quot;<i>That's what was always lacking in classical 
							music. If you want to clap, then just do it.</i>&quot;</p>

							Telegraph</a> below...</span></p>
							<span LANG>
							<p align="left">Forever Vienna, by the Dutch 
							violinist and conductor Andre Rieu and his Johann 
							Strauss Orchestra climbed 14 places to reach number 
							six after three weeks in the charts. Meanwhile Susan 
							Boyle's album, I Dreamed A Dream fell seven places 
							to number 11 following eight weeks in the charts.</p>
							<p align="left">The album, which features works such 
							as The Blue Danube and Radetzky March composed by 
							Strauss, has also reached number one in the 
							classical charts. Such was its popularity that shops 
							across the country ran out of copies in the first 
							week of its release. </p>
							<p align="left">The success of the album has partly 
							been attributed to the popularity of television 
							programmes such as Strictly Come Dancing and Dancing 
							on Ice. Mr Rieu has also made several appearances on 
							British television, including on the Royal Variety 
							Performance.</p>
							<p align="left">Gennaro Castaldo, a spokesman for 
							HMV, said: &quot;Never before has this music made it to 
							the top of the charts, but Andr� Rieu is the man to 
							do it. Being one of the music world�s best-kept 
							secrets, he certainly has a talent for bringing 
							traditional waltz music to life, to be enjoyed in 
							the way it was in its heyday. Rieu is adored by his 
							fans all over the world and with this album he has 
							shown music fans in the UK why.&quot;</p>
							<p align="left">&quot;The waltz encapsulates all emotions 
							in life, and this is why people love it,&quot; said Mr 
							Rieu, who has sold over 30 million albums worldwide. 
							&quot;This UK 'pop' chart entry is proof of that, so I am 
							thrilled.&quot; </p>

							ONE man owned music DVD sales last decade. That man 
							- Andre Rieu. He single handedly reinvented the 
							genre, selling more than two million copies of his 
							copious amount of live DVDs. However Pink's Funhouse 
							DVD, filmed in Sydney, made a late run to be the 
							most popular music DVD of the decade, selling more 
							than 300,000 copies in only three months of release. 
							Pink has three of the Top 5 sellers of the decade, 
							and Mr Rieu clocks up six titles in the Top 20.</p>

							An article on Andr� published just today. Below is 
							the first part of the article, read the full article
							<a href="https://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/classical/article6959210.ece">
							here</a>. A very interesting read!</p>

								<table border="0" width="97%" id="table94" style="border-collapse: collapse">
									<tr>
										<td><font size="2">As showbiz entrances 
										go, it could hardly be more spectacular. 
										A procession of musicians in lavish 
										period costumes parade through a 
										football stadium packed with 25,000 
										fans, to the tune of 76 Trombones. At 
										their head, �conducting�� them with a 
										violin bow as they wend their way 
										towards a colossal replica of a Hapsburg 
										palace that takes up an entire side of 
										the stadium, is a tall man in formal 
										attire, sporting a tail coat, a mullety 
										mane of grey hair and an enormous grin.<br>
							<br>
										And well might he grin. Because this is 
										Andr� Rieu, the so-called King of Waltz 
										� and the biggest-grossing male music 
										performer in the world. In Billboard 
										magazine�s summer list of the top 25 
										tours of the year, he lay in fourth 
										place, behind Madonna, Britney and Tina 
										Turner, and ahead of C�line Dion, AC/DC, 
										Bruce Springsteen and Elton John. He had 
										grossed more than �35m � double the 
										takings of Coldplay � and been seen by 
										more than 550,000 people. Six months 
										later, his 30th Anniversary Tour of 
										Europe tops the magazine�s Hot Tour 
										rankings.<br>
							<br>
										Yet, unless you caught his spot on the 
										Royal Variety Performance earlier this 
										month, when he arrived in Blackpool by 
										private jet with an entourage of more 
										than 100 � including the bodyguard whose 
										sole duty it is to baby-sit his �2m 
										Stradivarius � you will probably never 
										have heard of him.<br>
							<br>
										So, who is Andr� Rieu? He�s a 
										60-year-old Dutchman who lives in a 
										castle and loves the waltz. And he has a 
										dream: �To make classical music 
										accessible to everyone.� He�s doing a 
										pretty good job so far: with album and 
										DVD sales of 30m, his Johann Strauss 
										Orchestra is the most successful in the 
										world.<br>
							<br>
										Rieu grew up in a musical family in the 
										Catholic part of Holland, began learning 
										the violin at five and once thought of 
										becoming a priest � �but then girls 
										became too interesting� � before joining 
										his conductor father�s orchestra. Yet 
										even as a child, he found the atmosphere 
										of the concert hall stif�lingly sombre. 
										�Everybody looked so serious,� he says. 
										�The music radiated joy, but you were 
										not supposed to cough or laugh.� </font></td>

							What a difference half a century or so makes. When 
							this annual extravaganza was last in Blackpool in 
							1955, the bill included George Formby, Morecambe and 
							Wise, Norman Evans and Alma Cogan. Entrances and 
							exits were low key and props were kept to a minimum. 
							But times and tastes change and the 2009 edition was 
							as much like a military invasion - albeit a 
							colourful one - as it was a slice of showbusiness 
							history.</p>
							<p>But the 3,000 capacity venue was built for major 
							events like this and even with its future not 
							entirely secure, the place rose to the occasion in 
							magnificent style.</p>
							<p>.....The only standing ovation of the night went 
							to the jaw-dropping choreography of last year�s 
							Britain�s Got Talent winners Diversity

							Andre Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra brought

							<p>Award-winning comedian, Peter Kay, will host the

							delight to host it in Blackpool. �</p>

							<p>My passion for painting arose in the Vincent van

							meal! It's been the subject of many an interview and 
							features prominently on his DVD 'My Music, My Life', 
							and now this ultimate gift package, with its design 
							based on Andr�'s own castle, is released to

							will return to Auckland for another show in October 
							2010! Andr� Rieu, the Johann Strauss Orchestra and 
							his many soloist will take to the stage with an

							Andr� has just finished his (no doubt spectacular) 
							concerts in Sydney and Newcastle over in Australia, 
							I've just read on the Aussie fan site. - Which has 
							come back to life! Jann who runs the Aussie fan site 
							has managed to re-open her site, after closing it a 
							few weeks ago due to personal reasons, so we're glad 
							to have you back on board Jann!</p>
							<p>Now, for everyone attending the Auckland 
							concerts, wouldn't it be great if we could all get 
							to meet each other?? My family and I are going on 
							the Sunday night, so during the intermission, my 
							family and I will pop over to the left hand side 
							(from audience point of view) of the stage, we'll be 
							with our
							<a href="#less-than-two-weeks">signs</a>, so look 
							out for those. I'll have my camera with me so it'll 
							be great to meet and greet and snap a few photos!</p>
							<p>For those attending on the Saturday night, I 
							won't be there, however my sister and her husband 
							will be there holding up our signs, so look out for 
							them! </p>
							<p>Yesterday, I received an email from Dee from 
							Australia, and with it she had attached a picture, 
							which I thought was just absolutely brilliant. So 
							with Dee's permission, I've put it below as I think 
							it is most appropriate! Thanks Dee!</p>

							<p><i>Andr� Rieu is a violinist, conductor and 
							international star following sales of more than 10 
							million CDs worldwide. With his extravagant concerts 
							and compelling TV specials he has won the hearts of 
							millions of music lovers. Andr� Rieu was born in the 
							Netherlands, in 1949. He grew up surrounded 
							exclusively by classical music. Andre started taking 
							violin lessons at the age of five, the beginning of 
							a<br>
							love affair that would never end. As a student he 
							was asked to take part in a salon ensemble and as he 
							played his first waltz a whole new world opened up 
							for him. From that time on Andr� was hooked on the 
							waltzes� rhythm and dreamt of creating a large 
							orchestra that would enchant its audience. After 
							recruiting his own �Johann Strauss Orchestra� Andr� 
							began to tour. He has toured throughout<br>
							the world and won audience�s hearts everywhere he 
							goes. Crowned the �Waltz King�, Andr�s wish was to 
							make classical music accessible for everyone, and 
							this has undoubtedly come true. All over the world 
							millions of people of all ages enjoy going to his 
							concerts and listening to his music. My Music My 
							Life explores the story of Andr�s youth, growing up 
							in the Netherlands; the musical family he grew up 
							in; his music studies; and his extraordinary success 
							story. This fascinating biography was written by 
							Andr�s wife, Marjorie Rieu.</i></p>
							<div align="center">
								<p align="left"><b>Where can I buy??</b></p>
								<p align="left">There are currently two editions 
								of the book out in stores, the hardback and 
								paperback. The paperback is just the book on 
								it's own, whereas the hardback copy comes with a 
								free CD (advertised as 'Gift edition with CD'). 
								After looking online, I can safely say that the 
								book can be purchased at most (if not all) 
								leading major book stores, as well as your local 
								ones. So go and treat yourself, or somebody else 
								to the (I'm sure) fascinating story of Andr�

							<p><b>Now, just a news update in terms of tickets</b>. 
							Check out my
							<a href="tickets.html">Tickets</a> page, as there 
							are still a few people selling their tickets to the 
							(VERY) upcoming concerts in Auckland and Australia, 
							due to their own reasons. Laurie from the U.S. of 
							A., posted in my guest book only a few days ago 
							saying how she and her husband purchased tickets to 
							both the 24th &amp; 25th concerts, but due to conflicts 
							can no longer make it. Though they are very 
							disappointed that they cannot make it, they are 
							hoping to sell their tickets quickly. Laurie urges 
							anyone looking for GREAT seats (row 17 and row 10) 
							to contact her. Find more info on the
							<a href="tickets.html">Tickets</a> page.</p>
							<p>Secondly, tickets wise, Ticketmaster have made 
							available many more seats for both Auckland 
							concerts. Check out the Ticketmaster site
							<a href="https://www.ticketmaster.co.nz/Andre-Rieu-tickets/artist/773280">
							here</a>.</p>
							<p>Ok! As I said, the time is drawing near! You may 
							have seen this in the comments section on my 
							previous blog post. I think this list is absolutely 
							spot on. So I'd like to pass on the wise words of 
							Mother Superior from across the ditch (that's 
							Australia, for our far, far away friends :P) to all 
							of us first time concert goers, the what to bring 
							list.</p>

							ANDRE RIEU: SCARY MOMENTS DURING BALLOON TRIP</p>
							<p>I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO SCARED.</p>
							<p>It was suppose to be one of the 
							most beautiful experiences of his life for Andre 
							Rieu. High up in a hot air balloon over his beloved 
							home town Maastricht.<br>
							But the balloon trip turned out to be a disaster. 
							Andre was too scared to go higher then 3 meters and 
							even at that small height he broke out in a sweat.</p>
							<p>He takes everything on: the tours 
							all over the world, his concerts for millions of 
							people, the building of Schonbrunn Castle, he has 
							met the biggest names on earth.<br>
							Not long ago he told us about his dream to have a 
							concert on the moon.<br>
							As a child he was already very interested in the 
							universe and wants to learn more about it one day.

							<p>Andre was doing a commercial for

							Maastricht.<br>
							They filmed the scene with the ropes still attached 
							to the ground and the balloon only 3 meters above 
							ground. They will add different scenes of Maastricht 
							to it later.</p>
							<p>He thought he would be al right 
							doing this he said afterwards, till I had to climb

							I have fear for heights and that fear won and made 
							me not go ahead with the balloon flight which would

							I've just been contacted by a lovely 
							lady named Kathy who is wanting to attend Andr�'s 
							Maastricht concerts in 2011 (maybe 2010). She is 
							interested in finding out if there are any other 
							kiwi fans who are wanting to attend the concerts as 
							well, and possibly organize something together. In 
							case you don't know, the Maastricht concerts are a 
							huge event of the year; when Andr� performs in his 
							hometown.
							<a href="https://www.andrerieu.com/site/index.php?id=147">
							Here's</a> some info about the concerts in 
							Maastricht. </p>
							<p>So if there are any kiwi fans who 
							are wanting to or are planning on attending the 
							Maastricht concerts in 2011 and would like to go 
							over with someone; please let me know via the 
							<a href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=473909691045278539&postID=2759145878886910668">comments</a> and I'll get you in contact with Kathy.

							</i>Also, I just browsed through the guestbook

							part of. Dave Zimmerman from the USA, just emailed

							Dave said &quot;how about a come back?&quot; - Definitely! The 
							following people are also listed:</p>
							<p>Carla Maffioletti, Mirusia, Majorie Rieu, Carmen 
							Monarcha, Suzan Erens, Pierre Rieu, Frank Steins, 
							Manoe Konings, and Tanja Dewahl. </p>
							<p>So go ahead and vote! Only one vote per day per 
							nominee.<br>
							Thanks Dave for letting me know of this!</p>

								The violin-toting Dutch musician is credited 
								with bringing back the waltz, and his last 
								concert in Australia attracted a sell-out crowd 
								of 38,000. As comfortable cross-legged as he is 
								on stage, Rieu is clearing loving being back in 
								Australia - his self-professed home away from 
								home. Irrepressibly passionate about his music, 
								antipodean audiences it seems just cannot get 
								enough of Rieu. His brand of accessible populist 
								classics has certainly hit the right note.<br>
								<br>
								At his show in Melbourne last year, he shipped 
								in a castle, complete with ice-rink and 
								fountain, a 120-strong orchestra, a couple of 
								choirs and opera singers, a host of skaters and 
								dancers, and a horse-drawn carriage. He had a 
								good many of the audience waltzing in the aisles 
								and promises he'll have Kiwi audiences doing the 
								same in October. Rieu is very loyal to his 
								Aussie fanbase and visits regularly, and not 
								just to soak up the harbour views.<br>
								<br>
								He played live for them on Sunrise Australia 
								this morning and has even guest-starred on 
								Neighbours. &quot;Neighbours is a national treasure,&quot; 
								he says. &quot;I felt very honoured. I am glad I am 
								violinist not an actor.&quot;<br>
								<br>
								So would he consider an appearance on Shortland 
								Street when he heads to Auckland in October? &quot;I 
								could be a patient,&quot; he laughs. &quot;I think I'll be 
								a patient.&quot;<br>
								<br>
								While the castle won't be making the trip to 
								Auckland, Rieu's full orchestra will be and he's 
								already had a taste of his Kiwi fans. </span>

								A Dutch classical music superstar 
								who brought classical music to the masses 
								brought shopping to a halt at Auckland�s Sylvia 
								Park mall today.<br>
								<br>
								Andre Rieu�s first visit to New Zealand had 
								hundreds of the older generation acting like 
								teenagers. People had queued for hours to meet 
								the violinist.<br>
								<br>
								�My mother is 97 and a half and she will be 
								delighted to have her CD signed,� said fan Mary 
								Tomkinson.<br>
								<br>
								Mr Rieu has already wowed Australia with a 
								version of �Waltzing Matilda� and his new CD 
								opens with �Pokarekare Ana�.<br>
								<br>
								For those of a certain age Mr Rieu is bigger 
								than Elvis, although this was flying visit he 
								plans to return for his first ever New Zealand 
								show next October.<br>

							<span style="font-family: Verdana;">Andr� Rieu, Universal NZ's biggest selling artist of 
							the past two years, will now be meeting his many 
							fans at a signing session to take place at The 
							Warehouse store in Sylvia Park mall in Auckland this 
							coming Tuesday 2nd December at 1.30pm.<br>
							<br>
							Following the postponement of Andr� Rieu's scheduled 
							trip to New Zealand earlier this week, Universal 
							Music is very excited to announce that a new date 
							has been confirmed for Andre's first ever New 
							Zealand visit.<br>
							<br>
							Of the visit, Andr� says &quot;I am thrilled to be 
							visiting your beautiful country and am looking 
							forward to meeting all my New Zealand fans on 
							Tuesday!&quot;<br>
							<br>
							Andr� Rieu is nothing short of a global phenomenon 
							having sold close to 40 million CDs and DVDs 
							worldwide! In New Zealand Andr� has sold in excess 
							of 150,000 DVDs - the equivalent of 30 times 
							platinum sales! For three weeks in June 2008 alone, 
							six of the titles in the Top 10 Music DVD chart were 
							Andr� Rieu DVD's!<br>
							<br>
							Andr� is currently touring Australia and is taking 
							time out of his busy schedule to make a very special 
							trip to Auckland so he can meet his fans up close 
							and personal at a signing session to support the 
							release of his brand new CD Waltzing Matilda. The 
							special New Zealand edition of Waltzing Matilda 
							features Andre's own version of 'Pokarekare Ana,' 
							recorded especially for his Kiwi fans!<br>
							<br>
							Andr� will be meeting fans and signing copies of 
							Waltzing Matilda at 1.30pm on Tuesday at The 
							Warehouse store in the Sylvia Park shopping mall. 
							Bring your copy of Waltzing Matilda to be signed, or 
							purchase one from The Warehouse on the day. Make 
							sure you get there early - a previous signing 
							session at Melbourne's Telstra Dome saw more than 
							8,000 fans turn out to meet Andr�.<br>

							Don't miss this incredible once in a lifetime

							<span style="font-family: Verdana">Pokarekare Ana 
							is a traditional New Zealand love song, probably 
							communally composed about the time World War I began 
							in 1914. The song is very popular in New Zealand and

							in a more plodding 4/4 time.</span></p>

						<p>Earlier this year, Andr� Rieu's 
						�Waltzing Matilda� entered the Australian Album Charts 
						at No. 1. Since then his New Zealand fans have been 
						asking for this album to be released in New Zealand. 
						Finally local fans can get their own Special New Zealand 
						Edition of the album featuring a moving version of 'Pokarekare 
						Ana' recorded especially for his New Zealand fans.<br>
						<br>
						Sumptuously arranged for voice, solo violin, orchestra 
						and choir, the album features songs such as Botany Bay, 
						Waltzing Matilda, Tie My Kangaroo Down and Home Among 
						the Gum Trees.<br>
						<br>
						East Coast M&#257;ori song-writer Paraire Tomoana, who 
						polished up the song in 1917 and published the words in 
						1921, wrote that &quot;it emanated from the North of 
						Auckland&quot; and was popularised by M&#257;ori soldiers who were 
						training near Auckland before embarking for the war in 
						Europe.<br>
						<br>
						There have been numerous claims and counterclaims 
						regarding authorship over the years. Although the matter 
						has never been definitively settled, guardianship of the 
						words and music are held by the family (descendants) of 
						Paraire Tomoana.<br>
						The M&#257;ori words have remained virtually unaltered over 
						the decades, with only the waters in the first line 
						being localized. For example, some versions refer to 
						Rotorua, a town in the North Island. However, there have 
						been many different English translations.<br>

						Pokarekare ana, nga wai o Waiapu<br>
						Whiti atu koe hine, marino ana e<br>
						E hine e, hoki mai ra, ka mate ahau i te aroha e.<br>
						Tuhituhi taku reta, tuku atu taku riingi<br>
						<br>
						Kia kite to iwi, raruraru ana e.<br>
						E hine e, hoki mai ra, ka mate ahau i te aroha e.<br>
						Whatiwhati taku pene, kua pau aku pepa<br>
						Ko taku aroha, mau tonu ana e.<br>
						<br>
						E hine e, hoki mai ra, ka mate ahau i te aroha e.<br>
						E kore te aroha, e maroke i te ra<br>
						Makuku tonu i aku roimata e.<br>
						E hine e, hoki mai ra, ka mate ahau i te aroha e.<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						Stormy are the waters<br>
						Of restless Waiapu<br>
						If you cross them, girl<br>
						They will be calmed<br>
						<br>
						Oh girl<br>
						Come back to me<br>
						I could die<br>
						Of love for you<br>
						<br>
						I write you my letter<br>
						I send you my ring<br>
						So your people can see<br>
						How troubled I am<br>
						<br>
						Oh girl<br>
						Come back to me<br>
						I could die<br>
						Of love for you<br>
						<br>
						Oh girl<br>
						Come back to me<br>
						I could die<br>
						Of love for you</td>
