				<p><font size="2"><b>A new genre is introduced�</b><br>
				In 2007, my Nana &amp; Grandad gave my parents Andr� Rieu At 
				Sch�nbrunn Vienna. I saw the case and wasn�t too interested in 
				watching it at all. But I was encouraged to watch the DVD 
				anyhow. ��. And WOW! I am so glad I did! All the pieces Andr� 
				performed on it I had never heard before, apart from one or two, 
				but the enthusiasm, people and music at the concert just enticed 
				me. It just made me feel so�. energetic and happy! The music is 
				just amazing! Ever since, I�ve watched most of his other DVDs. - 
				Playing them twice! He is just truly amazing! I bought Andr� 
				Rieu: The 100 Most Beautiful Melodies, and listen to it on my 
				iPod whenever I can. My Nana &amp; Grandad and my parents and I 
				own altogether around 19 DVDs (I think), and often share them 
				together. <br>
				<b>*2009* </b>I will be attending the Sunday concert in October, 
				along with my both my grandparents and my Mum &amp; Dad. -We've got 
				the $199 tickets for row 22 :D<br>
				<b>*2010* </b>I will be attending the Auckland concert in 
				October '10, along with my Nana at Vector Arena on the 6th of 
				May. 
				We're in row four this time. Wahooooo!</font></p>
				<p><b><font size="2">A website is born�</font></b><font size="2"><br>
				On Sunday the 17th of May 2009, my Grandma was staying with us, 
				we decided we�d just check up on our tickets to Andr�s concert 
				in NZ. After talking about what we should wear to the concert, we 
				thought we should watch one of his DVDs and take note! We put on 
				Andr� Live in Australia and watched it, second time for me. It 
				was just so amazing again! I had one of those moments of 
				inspiration and thought, I�m sure I can do something! So I 
				started creating a fan website for Kiwi New Zealand fans. I got 
				really into it, and finished it on the following Friday, the 
				22nd. So now it�s online!</font></p>
				<p><font size="2">There are a lot of New Zealand fans of Andr� 
				Rieu, and we are all going to give Andr� and his JSO an awesome 
				time in NZ. It�s going to be exciting for me and other New 
				Zealand fans leading up to the concerts.</font></p>
				<p><font size="2">I'm glad I can be apart of and share the Andr� 
				magic with fans from up, down and around from everywhere!</font></p>
