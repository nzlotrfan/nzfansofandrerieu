						<p><font size="2">I realize that the title of this 
						report may seem a little strange because all of you know 
						that I fell for André several years ago when I first saw 
						him on PBS; however, there is a funny story regarding 
						this title. More on that later.<br>
						<br>
						We left the house at 2:30 to get to Reading by 4:30. Now 
						we only live one hour from the venue but they told us to 
						be there in time or we would not get in so of course I 
						was very nervous about the time. We arrived in plenty of 
						time and spent some time across the street at Quiznos 
						drinking Coke while I kept my eyes peeled on the Box 
						Office door. At 4:15 we decided to stand at the door, 
						not knowing that all that time the doors were open and 
						we could have gone in. It was a beautiful summer-type 
						day with blue skies – perfect weather for what would 
						turn out to be a perfect evening.<br>
						<br>
						At 4:30 Kerstin’s assistant (I am so sorry I forget his 
						name but I was so nervous) came to meet us and gave us 
						some hints of what was to come. I saw those passes 
						hanging on his arm and I just could not wait to get it 
						around my neck! He said &quot;follow me and we will go to see 
						André at the sound check&quot;. You know what is happening 
						but it is so hard to get your mind around it and of 
						course my body wasn’t getting it at all because I could 
						hardly walk due to my knees shaking. We walked into the 
						concert hall and our guide said &quot;there is the Maestro 
						practicing on his violin&quot;! I looked and didn’t see him 
						at first but he was sitting up front with his beautiful 
						violin and then I saw him from the back. We followed our 
						guide up to the front and he told us to sit anywhere we 
						would like. Well of course we all took the third row 
						directly across from André. (There were 4 of us at this 
						point; 2 joined us later). André looked over and waved 
						to us and he walked toward the stage for the start of 
						the sound check. I watched as he changed from his beige 
						jacket to the traditional blue jacket. I took some 
						photos of all this which you will see. All of a sudden I 
						heard the JSO playing the beautiful waltz &quot;Gold and 
						Silver&quot;. It was thrilling to hear this in an empty hall 
						and André was playing the violin with them. After this 
						he walked to the back and the Platin Tenors came out and 
						sang a little from Puccini that they will do in the 
						concert. The sound in that hall is tremendous and I was 
						hoping they would do the entire song but of course when 
						André was satisfied with the sound he cut them off. 
						Mirusia and Carla sang a few notes but it did not take 
						long before André was happy with the sound so that was 
						the end of the sound check. Oh, almost forgot that they 
						played Espana Cani and the &quot;bull&quot; came out but it was so 
						funny because they did not have the bottom part of the 
						costume on and all you could see were these legs (they 
						were wearing shorts) walking down the hall. It was so 
						funny.<br>
						<br>
						After that we followed our guide as he announced he 
						would take us to dinner. I was thinking we would 
						probably have a little room in the back and would be 
						treated to drinks and finger food. Well I almost had a 
						fit when we followed him into the dining room where 
						André and the JSO were having dinner. We were told to 
						get in line and feel free to take as much food as we 
						wanted. Well you know me, when excited the first thing 
						to go is my appetite! But I got in line and in front of 
						me was Carla. She immediately started talking to us and 
						said it was so nice to see us there. I find she is very 
						pleasant and friendly. So we had a nice conversation as 
						we waited with our plates. Just then André walked by us. 
						I said &quot;hello André&quot; and he said &quot;hello – bon appetite&quot;. 
						He then went to his table. The food was absolutely out 
						of this world. They had Weiner Schnitzel, stew which was 
						really pieces of roast beef with peppercorn, Tilapia, 
						all kind of vegetables and so many things I probably 
						missed. I took only a piece of beef and a veggie and a 
						bottle of water. By now my mouth was so dry I could 
						hardly talk. It was a hot day, about 93 (very 
						unseasonable for us) and it was very warm in the rooms 
						backstage. Clyde took full advantage of the food and had 
						seconds of dessert. Kerstin’s assistant sat with us as 
						well as Kerstin and we had a nice conversation with her. 
						She told me all about her new baby. She said the hardest 
						part of touring is missing the family. She told us that 
						this concert was not sold out and we were all discussing 
						the affects of the economy. Clyde asked about Central 
						Park and Kerstin told us that it is still on the table 
						but the logistics are enormous and the set is really too 
						big for the area. She told us that Toronto was the only 
						venue in which the full Schoenbrunn could be set up. I 
						told her we were at those two concerts and the set 
						looked absolutely stunning when you walked in and could 
						see the entire castle. Kerstin also said that regarding 
						Central Park the permitting is difficult but she also 
						said that if it is possible André will do it.<br>
						<br>
						Someone in the group mentioned how healthy André has 
						been and Kerstin said that he has not been ill for the 
						past 30 years. She also told us that they do not know 
						what they would do if anything would happen to André 
						because they have no one else. He is the show. She then 
						proceeded to tell us that André enjoys landing airplanes 
						on his I Phone, so when she cannot find him she knows 
						that he is landing planes.<br>
						<br>
						After the dinner we were escorted to the PBS Meet and 
						Greet where we joined our friends Nan Cole from Tampa 
						and Jolanta Szulc from New Jersey. We talked about an 
						hour and met with some of the JSO, Els Mercken and 
						Klaartje Polaan. This was Nan’s first time in Pa. and 
						she was having so much fun. Jolanta had never been to 
						the Sovereign Center so they were both in for a 
						wonderful concert.<br>
						<br>
						We found our seats and waited for that all familiar &quot;76 
						Trombones&quot; to begin. No matter how many times you hear 
						this it is always a heart stopping thrill. We had aisle 
						seats so – you guessed it – high five number 3!! Nan was 
						also high fived and was just so happy and I was happy 
						for her. All of you know the program by now so I will 
						not elaborate due to the length of this report. So many 
						things happened that night and I wanted this to be all 
						inclusive. I did not look at the program which Kerstin 
						had given us earlier so I did not know he was playing 
						&quot;Intermezzo Sinfonico&quot; but this is such a beautiful song 
						so I filmed it with my camera. Carla was just so cute 
						with her &quot;Lied von Olympia&quot;. &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; was 
						just heart stopping and it was so much fun watching the 
						girls do the Clog Dance. Here is where the strange title 
						of this report comes in. During &quot;Musik, Musik&quot; Frank 
						takes Polaroid photos of André and hands them to André 
						who in turn throws them onto the floor. Well I knew this 
						ahead of time and I jumped out of my seat and the photo 
						landing in front of me but then rolled to my right at 
						which time I went to turn and my heel slipped out from 
						under me and I landed flat on the floor, thankfully on 
						my fanny. All I could think of was how embarrassing this 
						is and then Joe Fabrizio who was sitting next to us put 
						his hands under my shoulders and picked me up from the 
						floor. Photos were still flying from the stage as I made 
						my way to my seat with the picture still in my hand. I 
						thought I am not losing this since I really worked hard 
						for it!! So you can see how I really fell hard for André 
						this time. The remainder of the concert was just as 
						wonderful as always. He did not play &quot;Elyen a Magyar&quot; 
						which is listed in the program and left out &quot;Marina&quot; 
						during the encores. I was having camera problems again 
						and will be getting a new one in the not too distant 
						future. Luckily I had my sister’s camera as a backup. 
						The concert ended too soon as it always does but we had 
						such a ball! Oh! forgot to mention that right after 
						Carla’s number she was clowning with André and I missed 
						what happened but André dropped his bow and it landed on 
						the stage. He didn’t look too happy about that but took 
						it with a smile.<br>
						<br>
						But we still had more to come as we met Kerstin at the 
						entrance to the concert hall. We were escorted to the 
						same room and there was a large table with champagne and 
						they were also set up with finger food along the side of 
						the room. André was there and welcomed us with a 
						handshake and we took our seats at the table. I know I 
						sound very cool and collected about all this but believe 
						me I was anything but calm at the time! We drank a 
						little bit of champagne but I still could not eat 
						anything. I was going to get some meatballs when I saw 
						André approaching our table and I just stopped dead. I 
						thought ‘forget the food and stay where you are.’ André 
						again shook our hands and I sat down. I thought I had 
						better sit before my knees completely turned to jelly. 
						He talked to us for a while and then Clyde said &quot;André, 
						Jeanine is taking violin lessons for over a year&quot; (I 
						would have never opened my mouth about this) and he 
						seemed impressed and I watched his eyes and they 
						immediately went straight to my left hand to see if I 
						had no fingernails to speak of as a way of checking out 
						if this was a true story. He said &quot;a year, huh?&quot; and I 
						said &quot;yes&quot; and he said &quot;well, when you make music it is 
						a better and happier world&quot;. I am really dying inside 
						while all this is going on. Then André said &quot;enjoy your 
						drinks and then we will make some pictures&quot;. We also 
						noticed André finger on the right hand was bruised and 
						he told us that was from holding the bow so long.<br>
						<br>
						They started to set up the curtain for the photos and we 
						all took our turns for this fantastic event. André put 
						his hand firmly around my arm and I didn’t know what to 
						do with my other arm so I put it around his waist. It 
						was wonderful to be that close and I was hoping they had 
						a slow photographer. But the nice thing is I got to do 
						it again because they took the photo with me, André and 
						Clyde and then Clyde (not being a shy person) asked 
						André if he would allow another photo with just him and 
						me. André gladly obliged so I found myself back beside 
						him. You can only imagine how I am feeling about this 
						time. It seemed so surreal at the moment but I surely 
						thought about it all night.<br>
						<br>
						In conclusion I just want to tell you a little about the 
						conversations we had with Frank Steijns, Mirusia, Bela, 
						Tomas and Gary who were at our table. Clyde mostly 
						talked with Tomas about his son and his home. We both 
						talked with Mirusia about the Aussie bushfires and her 
						home and family and I spoke at length with Frank about 
						violins. Mirusia told us that when she was growing up 
						she would sing a question or comment rather than talk 
						and I thought that was kind of neat. Bela has this 
						adorable dinosaur &quot;Johnny&quot; which he saw in Japan and 
						then ordered it through the internet. I think it just 
						came recently and it was made of rubber and moved his 
						body and opened his little mouth and you could put your 
						finger in his mouth and it would try to bite. He was 
						having lots of fun with that.<br>
						<br>
						We picked up our photos which André was kind enough to 
						autograph once they were dry and also a DVD gift. We 
						thanked Kerstin for her hospitality and once again we 
						shook hands with André and bid him farewell as I floated 
						out of the room. To say that my dream has finally come 
						true is really an understatement but this is one night I 
						will never forget and as André says in his concerts 
						&quot;this is the most beautiful night of my life&quot;.</font>&nbsp;</td>
