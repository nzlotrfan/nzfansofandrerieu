                >After 12 months of planning on Thursday 8th July we arrived by
                train in Maastricht. Arriving at the hotel we meet the first of
                the many Andr� fans from around the world who descend on
                Maastricht at this time.</font

                >Europe was in the grips of a heat wave at this time. While last
                year visitors were out trying to buy thermals, this year
                everyone was out buying fans and trying to find somewhere cool.
                Anywhere that had air conditioning was very popular.<br />
                Late in the afternoon from our hotel room we watched and
                listened as Andr� and the orchestra, choir and soloists went
                through the sound check. It was funny to watch Andr� riding
                around on a seqway (not sure this is the right word) checking
                the sound from all parts of the square and making sure everyone
                would have perfect acoustics. During this time the crowd in the
                area of the square slowly built up and around 9.30pm the gates
                were opened and there was a made dash to get the best seats to
                watch the dress rehearsal. Again this was fun as Andr� tried
                different presentations for the items to be performed. We now
                had a good idea what the program would be and this only
                increased the excitement for the concert the next evening. The
                dress rehearsal finally finished about midnight and we went to
                bed excited about the first concert the next night.</font

                >Friday night rolled around and after advice from various fans
                we meet about 8.00pm we went to the front of the Theatre in
                preparation for the concert. This is where the performers get
                ready for the concert and is an ideal place to meet them. The
                first person we meet was Carmen (soloist) and what a delight she
                is. She was more than willing to talk to us and became very
                animated when I asked her when we could expect her CD. She
                explained that with her schedule she was having trouble
                completing it, but that hopefully it will not be too much
                longer. She then posed with us for a photo before going to get
                ready. We then saw various other orchestra members stranding
                around chatting, eating ice cream, smoking and just relaxing.
                Everyone we approached was more than willing to stop and talk to
                us and have photos taken. We spoke to Agnes (violin) and Nadia
                (viola) about New Zealand and they were very complimentary about
                their visit last year and are looking forward to coming back in
                October. During this time Dad was interviewed by the local TV
                station, at first he had no idea what was going on but managed
                to give a good interview. This can be seen on Ineke and Ruuds
                website. Then it was off to find our seats. While waiting for
                the concert to begin a local band marches around the square
                entertaining the crowds. When they finished the opening bars of
                76 Trombones began and Andr� and the Orchestra were entering the
                square and moving onto the stage. The excitement in the audience
                was palpable with everyone clapping and swaying, a great night
                had begun.</font

                >I am sure you have all seen details of the concert itself so
                will not go into that other than to give our impression. The
                concert was up to Andr�s high standard and the Carmen, Mirusia
                and Kimmi (the Black diamond from South Africa) were amazing as
                always. The Platin Tenors were there usual brilliant best, and I
                always think it would be nice to hear more from them. In the
                first half the highlight for me was the African children and the
                fun they had which spilled over to the audience. They were
                greeted with tremendous applause and it seems Andr� has again
                uncovered some potential performers. During the second half
                Andr� highlighted two of our favourite orchestra members in
                Tanya (cellist) and Manoe (clarinet, bagpipes and anything else
                you can think of). This showcase of their talents was
                exceptional and highlighted what talent there is within the
                orchestra. The concert finished with the usual array of encores,
                and the Limburg anthem and a local Maastricht song, which got
                all the locals involved and it was great to be in the middle of
                the audience. By the end of the evening we were more than
                pleased with the concert and so happy we had decided to make the
                long journey.</font

                >The next day was the Fan dinner on the riverboat. This was
                attended d by 73 people from 12 countries. We were lucky enough
                to be the first New Zealanders to attend. Gerd Leers the former
                mayor of Maastricht did the formal welcome and we were lucky
                that Gary Bennett also attended for a time. This was a great
                time to meet many of the people we had been messaging on the
                various websites. We had a lovely buffet meal on a lovely
                setting, the Maas river. Ineke and Ruud did a wonderful job
                organizing this and everyone had a great time getting to know
                each other. The dinner finished in time for those attending that
                nights concert to get there in plenty of time.</font

                >We did not attend that nights concert but watched it from our
                room. The surprise was the appearance of DJ �tzi, who had not
                been at the concert the previous night. He is a great
                entertainer who had the whole audience singing along to Sweet
                Caroline. It was a great sight watching the people in the cafes
                joining in and interacting during the concert.<br />
                As Holland had made the World Cup soccer final and that was due
                to start at the same time as the concert, the concert was moved
                to 1.00pm. As we were expecting another really hot day they
                moved the concert to the MECC, an indoor concert venue. This
                gave us another perspective to the concerts. The walls of the
                concert hall had facades put up to make it look like the cafes
                on the square, and there were 93 chandeliers hung. When we went
                into the hall all the chairs had orange hats and fans on them.
                When we opened the box with the fans we found that the fans we
                had were blue and on looking around saw that others had orange
                ones, so being a bit cheeky (not at all like me) I went to some
                empty seats and when I found orange ones swapped them for ours.
                Sorry to the people who got the blue ones. It was another
                polished and impressive concert with both the Berlin Harmonists
                and DJ �tzi.</font

                into a soccer arena and they were expecting 10,000 people to
                watch the soccer final. And so we joined what turned out to be
                closer to 20,000 fans to cheer on Holland. What a shame they
                were disappointed!</font

                after the fireworks had gone off at the end of the concert there
                was a fire in the rafters of the stage. Andr� and the Orchestra
                were very professional and completed the concert before vacating
                the stage so they could put the fire out. I am sure many people
                did not even realise what had occurred.</font

                >Our final concert was the Friday night and I am ashamed to say
                we left at the interval. Just as we were making our way to our
                seats the heavens opened and there was a heavy downfall of rain.
                We were absolutely drenched, even though Andr� had put out
                ponchos it was to late by the time we got to our seats. As we
                had to leave early the next morning for London at the interval
                we decided it was getting cold and so we went back to our room
                got dry and watched the rest from the warmth and dryness of our
                room. This was unfortunate as it was Dads 86th birthday and was
                meant to be a treat for him. But as it turned out this concert
                was a highlight for Dad as he meet and had his photo taken with
                Manoe. Manoe was the one member of the orchestra he had wanted
                to meet right from the time we decided to go to
                Maastricht.</font

                from around the world, to meeting the members of the orchestra,
                choir and the soloists, to the concerts themselves we had a

                you all but we did enjoy meeting everyone for however brief a
                time. And finally to Andr� and the Orchestra, Choir and Soloists
                thank you for amazing concerts that we will remember forever.
