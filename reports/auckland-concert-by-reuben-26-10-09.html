						<p><font size="2">On the Saturday morning we left for 
						Auckland at 11:30, arriving in Auckland early afternoon. 
						Though my expectations were high, I don’t think I was 
						still truly prepared for the amazing night my Dad and I 
						would have in only just a few hours. But quickly the 
						early evening came about, we were all dressed up in our 
						fancy clothes and at quarter past six we were off to 
						dinner. Before we knew it, after a lovely dinner, (which 
						seemed to fly by quite fast) we were off in the car, Mum 
						in the driver’s seat and Dad and I passenger-ing. We 
						were off! Heading for the arena. André here we come!</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">Now you see, I hadn’t planned on 
						coming on the Saturday night; however a family member 
						who was planning on attending could suddenly no longer 
						make it. So at such short notice, and after doing a bit 
						of last minute phoning, I was put forward to go. So I 
						was lucky enough to go both on Saturday and Sunday (yay!).
						<br>
						We arrived at the arena at 7:30PM, precisely half an 
						hour before the show was due to start (we were a bit 
						late in leaving dinner). We found our seats, and met 
						Kathy with her Mum, then we all awaited for that all too 
						familiar piece to begin. ‘Seventy Six Trombones’ da da 
						da da, da, da, da da da da daaaaa and so on it went! 
						They came down the aisles and everyone was clapping and 
						taking their photos. Ah, very exciting! </font></p>

						<p><font size="2">We were treated to the tenors performing to their 
						absolute best in full voice, and Carmen, Mirusia, and 
						Kalki 
						performed to their absolute finest, both trios wowing 
						the audience to standing ovations. I saved myself from 
						reading the Australian concert reports as I knew this 
						concert was the same one that was in currently touring, to keep 
						everything a surprise. So when André started playing 
						‘Ben’, my Dad and I wondered in our seats whether Carmen 
						would come out and perform ‘The Earth Song’ (which I am 
						in love with after watching LIM3). Then André announced 
						it, Carmen came out and gave a spectacular performance. 
						Also, the children standing behind her were from 
						Auckland Grammar School, so that was great to see some 
						local input. In particular to the New Zealand concerts 
						though, Mirusia performed Pokarekare Ana, which was well 
						received with a full standing ovation, she sang it 
						absolutely beautifully. She performed it just after her 
						astounding yet effortless performance of Andrew Lloyd 
						Webber’s ‘Memory’ from Cats. </font></p>

						<p><font size="2">New Zealand proved itself worthy 
						dancing wise. During André’s performance of the Blue 
						Danube, there were people up and dancing with each other 
						all over the floor. It was absolutely great to see, and 
						watch André tease the people dancing by pausing during 
						the piece. Near the ‘end’ of the concert after André 
						announced that this would be his final piece, the crowd 
						shouted ‘more!’ and André gave us what we asked for! He 
						gave a lot of encores in fact, I’m going to say seven 
						maybe (someone might be able to correct me on that one), 
						but there were a lot anyway, so it was really exciting. 
						With the balloons coming down people (including me and 
						Kathy) were up out of their seats and dancing in the 
						moshpit amongst the balloons. </font></p>

						<p><font size="2">Sunday in comparison was roughly the 
						same with a few things different in André’s dialogue, we 
						also met KiwiBarbara for the first time too, and other 
						people through the website. So, if I have not already 
						said, the concerts were absolutely FANTASTIC. I 
						hope everyone goes to see at least one André concert, it 
						is truly an unforgettable experience.</font></p>
